The codes contain the following parts:
1. ``gx.m'': The intrinsic function of each node, where $g(z)=-z+D\cdot h$;
2. ``hx.m'': The function $h(z)$ contained in $g(z)$;
3. ``FindROT.m'': Choose the proper matrices and parameters for the sufficient conditions;
4. ``FET.m'': Simulation 1, which shows the finite-time synchronization is realized, resulting in Figure 2;
5. ``time\_energy\_FET.m'': Simulation 1, which shows the dynamics of settling time (synchronization time) $T$ and energy consumption $\mathcal{E}$ under different control gains $q_1$, and evaluation function $\Phi$ under $q_1,\delta$, resulting in Figures 3, 4. (a) and 4. (c);
6. ``time\_energy\_FET\_2D.m'': Simulation 1, resulting in Figures 4. (b) and 4. (d);
7. ``F\_finite\_time.m'': Simulation 1, which shows dynamics of comparison function $F$ under different norm parameters $p$, resulting in Figure 5;
8. ``generalized\_expint.m'': The function of generalized exponential integral;
9. ``PTS.m'': Simulation 2, which shows the prescribed-time synchronization is realized, resulting in Figure 6;
10. ``F\_prescribed\_time.m'': Simulation 2, which shows dynamics of comparison function $F$ under different norm parameters $p$, resulting in Figure 7
